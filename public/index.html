        <p>You are marooned on your computer. A desert island of silicon and fiber optics.</p>
        <p>Write a message, stuff it in a bottle, and cast it off to sea. Eventually, it will wash ashore somewhere far away. Someone will find it, read it, acknowledge it. They'll have no idea who you are or how to get in touch with you. And when they're done reading it, the message will disappear. No record of it anywhere in the cyber seas.</p>
        <p>Once you've sent your message, keep this tab open. If you're lucky, a message will arrive from some other person stranded on their own silicon island.</p>
